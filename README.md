Design Decisions

1. Instead of hard coding the values such as 'Asked Rent' and 'Taxes', I am treating this as a react component and accept them as props. This is because I assume the values will change based on how the user interacts with the website.

2. I am going to use the opportunity for delight on the information icons, and make some text pop up when the user hovers over them.
